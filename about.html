                        Real estate, for most people, is either an exciting adventure or a word that immediately
                        triggers stress. Shady deals, agents who talk in circles, that feeling you’re being sold
                        something you don’t really want - we get it, it can be a bit tiring, as the industry hasn’t
                        always had the best reputation. But that’s exactly why Saban & Co was born ; To shake things up,
                        to do real estate the right way, ie, ethically, transparently, and always with your best
                        interest at heart.

                        Our story isn’t your usual “we’re great, please pick us” kind of story, as our company was built
                        upon perseverance, passion, a tad bit of rebellion, and the kind of curiosity that cannot be
                        satiated in the absence of perfection.

                        It all began with our founder, Suhail Saban.

                        At just 17, while most teens find themselves being uncertain and indecisive about their passion,
                        Suhail was already mastering the art of sales. After proving himself to be a pro at sales across
                        different companies, Suhail was introduced to the world of real estate by a friend's father who
                        noticed his exceptional talent.

                        With his first successful property deal, Suhail discovered his knack for real estate brokering,
                        and then quickly went on to make a name for himself within the industry. A natural talker with
                        the charm to match, his goals were pretty simple and straightforward: to work hard, stay real,
                        and make an honest living. Thanks to his consistent efforts, by 21, he wasn’t just “doing well.”
                        He’d become the youngest realtor in Dubai, a tough city that eats most newcomers alive. It
                        wasn’t luck or connections that got him there. His recipe for success was long days, longer
                        nights, and a sheer belief in himself.

                        But life isn’t a straight road, is it? The moment that changed everything for Suhail wasn’t
                        about success. It was about loss. After a big property deal, he was denied the commission he
                        rightfully earned. A moment like that hits hard. He could’ve called it quits, like so many do.
                        Instead, he saw an opportunity. That day, he decided to build something different — a real
                        estate company that values ethics above all else. A place where no one feels cheated, and where
                        trust isn’t just a word but a strong promise.

                        And so, Saban & Co was born.

                        Saban & Co is the brokerage firm working under its parent company, Saban & Collective. Under our
                        parent company, we intend to roll out our manufacturing and development brands in the near
                        future.

                        Saban & Co started our journey in Mumbai, the city of endless opportunities, with a small
                        office, a big idea, and lots and lots of determination. Before we knew it, Mumbai led to
                        Bangalore, Bangalore led to Dubai, and here we are today expanding further, stronger, and
                        smarter.

                        Saban & Co is already a well-established name with its sister company Spectrum Global Trading
                        LLC at Dubai, and we are now partnering with Mor Homes, one of the most trustable names in the
                        real estate industry to open our newest office in Kozhikode. While we aren’t involved in local
                        Kozhikode properties, this office acts as our headquarters for investments across the cities of
                        Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Dubai.
